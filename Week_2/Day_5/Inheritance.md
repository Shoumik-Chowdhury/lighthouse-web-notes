# Inheritance
With inheritance, we can build a new class based on an existing class.
Example:
```js
// This class represents all that is common between Student and Mentor
class Person {

  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }

}
```
```js
class Student extends Person {
  // stays in Student class since it's specific to students only
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // specific to mentors
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }
}
```
The class student and mentor above are the same as:
```js
class Student {

  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  // here is a method that is specific to students
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

class Mentor {

  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}
```
The `bio()` and `constructor()` are same in `Student` and `Mentor` so we move them to another class `Person`.

# Super
Sometimes you want a subclass to have similar but slightly different behaviour to its superclass. In our scenario, what if we want all mentor bios to start with "I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs." before saying the "My name is ..." bit?
## Option 1: Method Overwrite
```js
// Superclass
class Person {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

// Subclass
class Mentor extends Person {
  // Completely re-define the bio method since it has more to say
  bio() {
    return `I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs. My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}
```
## Option 2: Use Super
```js
// Super class
class Person {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // Mentor bios need to include a bit more info
  bio() {
    return `I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs. ${super.bio()}`;
  }
}
```
